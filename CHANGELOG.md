# Changelog

User-facing changes per release, newest first. The desktop updater shows the
one-line summary; this file is the full story. Versions follow
`frontend/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-09-03 (the launch release)

Everything the launch-readiness pass found, in one update.

### Added
- **Download your data.** Settings → Privacy & Safety will produce a single
  JSON file holding your account's own rows — profile, memberships, friends,
  the messages you wrote, tasks, uploads, devices and preferences — decrypted
  on your own machine by your own keys, with anything this device cannot open
  left as ciphertext and counted in the summary. It asks for your password,
  and allows one export a minute. Other people's messages are not included:
  they are theirs.
- **A plain statement of what leaves your device and what your server can
  see**, in Settings → Privacy & Safety, next to the export. It names the
  metadata a server operator can read, what it cannot read, and the two
  places anything is fetched from a third party.

### Fixed
- **Voice hotkeys that worked about half the time.** Push-to-talk, mute and
  deafen from inside a game now come from two independent sources: the system
  hook, and a 20 ms check of the physical key state that catches a press or
  release the hook missed. Windows removes a hook without warning when the
  machine is loaded, and a key released on a security prompt was never seen
  at all; one lost release used to leave push-to-talk open and swallow the
  next press too, which is why it felt like every other press worked.
  Hotkeys could also vanish whenever the app wrongly believed it still had
  focus while a game was in front, and for a mouse button pressed with the
  pointer outside the window; the answer now comes from Windows itself. Keys
  sent by a gaming mouse's own software (G HUB, Synapse) or by AutoHotkey
  were being ignored as "injected"; only Púca's own remote-control input is
  now. A game going fullscreen mid-call used to restart the whole hotkey
  system, closing a held push-to-talk. A Ctrl or Shift pressed in the same
  instant as its key could go unseen by a toggle. A hotkey on a mouse button
  no longer stops working while the message box you type in has focus, and a
  quick settings change can no longer leave one keypress handled twice. If a
  game runs as administrator, Windows hides its keys from every program that
  does not, and Púca now says so in a banner instead of failing silently.
- **Taskbar pins and shortcuts left dead by the 0.9.0 rename.** 0.9.0 renamed
  the program file from `app.exe` to `Puca.exe` (`Puca-Lite.exe` for Lite), and
  a taskbar pin you made yourself kept pointing at the old name. This update's
  installer repairs every pin and shortcut of ours that no longer resolves. If
  a pin still shows an error afterwards, unpin it and pin Puca again from the
  Start Menu.
- Password-reset and email-verification tokens are stored hashed on the
  server; a database dump no longer contains a usable reset link.
- The obsolete `sessions` table (raw login session keys, written by nothing
  since 0.9.0) is dropped.
- **Updates could stop looking after one wrong answer.** The desktop and
  mobile update checks try more than one address; a reply from something that
  was not Púca used to end the search instead of moving on to the next one,
  leaving the app on an old version with no sign anything was wrong. The
  failure message now names what would help.
- Joining a call from Firefox, Safari or iOS now says up front that the
  browser cannot encrypt live media, and what your options are, instead of
  the call simply being silent in one direction.
- Sharing a folder that sits on a network drive is refused when you pick it,
  naming the reason, rather than being accepted and then failing on every
  browse.

### Security
- Keystrokes sent by someone controlling this machine through My Devices
  still cannot trigger its owner's hotkeys. The new key-state check added
  for reliability reads the same table Windows fills for injected input, so
  it is explicitly blinded to keys Púca itself is injecting.

### Changed
- **Deleting your account now also removes the files you uploaded** —
  attachments, your avatar, sounds — after a 30-day grace period (operators
  can set `DELETED_ACCOUNT_FILE_GRACE_DAYS`). Server icons and custom emoji
  you contributed stay with the server. The deletion screen says so.
- On the desktop, the "remember this device" seed for unattended remote
  control is sealed with Windows data protection (DPAPI) instead of being
  kept in the app's web storage.
- The WebSocket no longer accepts a session token in the URL; every app
  since 0.9.0 sends it in a header. A native background helper older than
  0.9.0 updates together with the desktop app.

### For self-hosters
- Relay (TURN) responses are verified for integrity end to end; the check has
  been proven against a production coturn.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-09-03

### Added
- Sign out on one device without touching the others, and revoking a device
  from the Devices tab now really ends its sessions.
- Invites are a permission (Create Invites); attaching files is honoured at
  the upload door; camera and screen share are permission-checked before a
  single frame is sent, and other people's video is shown only once the
  server has confirmed it.
- Messages show an "(edited)" marker.

### Fixed
- In-app password change was refused on 0.8.136; it works again.
- Invite links expired early on servers whose database runs in a non-UTC
  time zone.

### Security
- File transfers and mesh calls pin the other side's connection certificate
  through the identity-authenticated handshake; channel keys are bound to
  their channel and epoch; deleting an account scrubs device shares, wrapped
  keys and device names; the agent's file jail and relay handling were
  hardened; offsite backups refuse to ship unencrypted.

### Changed
- The Windows program file is now `Puca.exe` / `Puca-Lite.exe`.
- Existing remote-control file grants under system folders (AppData,
  Program Files) are refused from this version on.
